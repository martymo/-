A place for me to store an assortment of small programming puzzles or exercises
in a variety of languages. Most of them are not difficult and should be done in 
a not too lengthy programme without intensive tests needed. But they should have
some computable metrits, and hopefully, a backstory behind it.

## Puzzles and exercises

### A cross number puzzle (p001-cross-number-puzzle)

Fill in the cross number puzzle using the following numbers:

2 digits: 24, 27, 31, 54, 59, 99
4 digits: 1975, 1991, 1992, 4351

```

This puzzle is from a grade 5 Math exercise book. I thought it
would be a good exercise to see if there was really a solution to it.
